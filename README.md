# LearningCenterCore

This is the initial tutorial site for Vorakor Technologies Learning Center, though there may be some other code coming in later.

## User Requirements

- Video playback - We want to be able to watch the tutorial videos and match the resolution to our bandwidth capabilities. Watch, rewatch, or find other videos related to the most recently viewed video.
- Video storage - We need a way to store produced videos, we do not need to download them as they will be available online forever. We need them to be compressed and quickly decompress and view them, we may also want to encrypt / decrypt the videos to secure them for users of the site.
- Comments - Allow users to comment on other comments or the videos themselves.
- Likes or Dislikes - Allow users to like or dislike comments or videos themselves. If they like a video add that video to their favorites.
- Transcript - A full document transcript on the audio in the videos along with timestamps so that users can find specific parts of the video and rewatch or go back through the transcript to read through parts they want to review.
- User system - Single Sign On if possible, email as username, password, first name and last name, date joined, preferences for videos that they want to see over others, what technologies they have experience in, what level they are currently at in their career, also pick a comment display name, the country they reside in, and technologies they want to learn.
- User favorites - Favorite tutorial videos, favorite series of videos, or they can favorite a section in a transcript to highlight a particular segment of a video.
- Admin Panel:
  - Admin login - Admin login is locked down to moderators or admins only, create admin / moderator privilege for admins only.
  - Admin review new comments (AI assist to look for derogatory comments) - This is only for negative comments.
  - Admin upload new video - provide video title, series, series number (what part in the series is it), run time, and other related meta data.
  - Admin user management - Block users who keep making negative comments, add moderators, add additional admins.
  - Admin review community feedback - Add future features and issues / improvements to backlog, add volunteers to volunteer list.
- Community Feedback - Provide an area where users can suggest improvements to code, point out issues in existing code, suggest future features they want to see as a part of the Learning Center, or volunteer to take part in the Learning Center.
- LinkedIn / Facebook group pages, links for users to share with others to come to Learning Center site.

## Future Features

- Video Editing - this will allow us to edit sections of videos and splice them together to group them into a related topic, for example: if a video series goes in depth with Python and has a React front end, we may want to splice the Python parts together and the React parts together to form separate Python and React training modules.
- Education Module Creator - Provide a way for users to create training modules to help their fellow developers learn to code or learn to code at a higher level.
- Automated post creation for LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Tiktok, and Twitter (if there are others feel free to mention them in the community feedback portal).
